# Arrays

Linear Data Structure

## Implementation
- Check [this](Array.cpp) to look at a few basic array operations.

## Errors
- When reading in an array, it is possible to overwrite memory that does not belong to the array.
- Accessing elements outside the array.

## Complexity
- Time:
    - Access Element:
        - Worst Case: ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=O(1))
        - Average Case: ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=O(1))
    - Search Element:
        - Worst Case: ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=O(n))
        - Average Case: ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=O(n))
    - Delete Element: 
        - Worst Case: ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=O(n))
        - Average Case: ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=O(n))
- Space:
    - Worst Case: ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=O(n))

## Applications
- Used in the implementation of other data structures like linked lists, etc.
- Used in mathematical problems such as matrices, etc.
- Used in lookup tables by computer
- It effectively executes memory addressing logic wherein indices act as addresses to the one-dimensional array of memory
