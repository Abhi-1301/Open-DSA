# Arrays

Linear Data Structure

## Implementation
- Check [this](Array.cpp) to look at a few basic array operations.

## Errors
- When reading in an array, it is possible to overwrite memory that does not belong to the array.
- Accessing elements outside the array.

## Time Complexities

- Access Element - ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=O(1))
- Search Element - ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=O(n)) (For Linear Search)
- Delete Element - ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=O(n)) (Shift the rest of the lements to the left)

## Applications
- Used in the implementation of other data structures like linked lists, etc.
- Used in mathematical problems such as matrices, etc.
- Used in lookup tables by computer
- It effectively executes memory addressing logic wherein indices act as addresses to the one-dimensional array of memory
